# Requirements
## Project Requirements
This crowdfunding project must:

- [x] Be separated into two distinct projects: an API built using the Django Rest Framework and a website built using React. [React front end coming soon!]
- [x] Have a cool name, bonus points if it includes a pun and/or missing vowels. See https://namelix.com/ for inspiration. <sup><sup>(Bonus Points are meaningless)</sup></sup>
- [ ] Have a clear target audience.
- [x] Have user accounts. A user should have at least the following attributes:
  - [x] Username
  - [x] Email address
  - [x] Password
- [x] Ability to create a “project” to be crowdfunded which will include at least the following attributes:
  - [x] Title
  - [x] Owner (a user)
  - [x] Description
  - [x] Image
  - [x] Target amount to fundraise
  - [x] Whether it is currently open to accepting new supporters or not
  - [x] When the project was created
- [x] Ability to “pledge” to a project. A pledge should include at least the following attributes:
  - [x] An amount
  - [x] The project the pledge is for
  - [x] The supporter/user (i.e. who created the pledge)
  - [x] Whether the pledge is anonymous or not
  - [x] A comment to go along with the pledge
- [ ] Implement suitable update/delete functionality, e.g. should a project owner be allowed to update a project description?
- [ ] Implement suitable permissions, e.g. who is allowed to delete a pledge?
- [ ] Return the relevant status codes for both successful and unsuccessful requests to the API.
- [ ] Handle failed requests gracefully (e.g. you should have a custom 404 page rather than the default error page). [Coming soon on the React front end!]
- [x] Use Token Authentication, including an endpoint to obtain a token along with the current user's details.
- [ ] Implement responsive design. [Coming soon on the React front end!]
